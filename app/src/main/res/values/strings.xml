    <!-- ***********About us *********-->
    <string name="about_academy">
        The SH Academy is an international learn to swim
        program member of the United States Swim Schools Association (www.asaswimming.com)
        \nThe SH Academy methods are based on up-to-date and common knowledge of sports/swimming science
        and teaching methods. The step by step program makes sure your child will be prepared, educated
        and trained under the aspects of ergonomic, growth acceleration and physiology to swim
        for health, safety, fun and fitness as well as it will set up the base for competitive
        aquatic sports.

        \n\nChildren must be at least 5 years old to start the SH Academy Step program.
        \nThe classes on step 1 to 7 have a coaches/swimmers ratio of 1:8

        \n\nStep Description:
        The SH Academy teaches children in a step by step process a foundation of water safety and proper
        swimming technique
        \nThe child may have other swimming skills, but will not excel without the foundation of water adaptation,
        water experience and breathing foundation.
        \n Each term to promote the children to the next step
    </string>


    <string name="about_SH">
        We are an Academy based on international knowledge of swimming, years of experience
        from learn to swim up till high level competitive swimming and most of all passion
        for the sport.
        \nOur Mission is to introduce our members to the water and friendship close with water
        for lifetime.
        Wherever the path leads - competitive aquatics, fitness and health, recreational swimming or just enjoy
        - we guarantee to teach skills of safety, confidence and opportunity.
    </string>


    <string name="for_parents">
        Parents of SH Aquatic members are expected to adhere to the following guidelines
        and supervision requirements.
        These guidelines are designed to promote and ensure a positive and safe experience
        for everyone:
    </string>


    <string name="pool">
        All SH Aquatic members will be required to use the separate entrance to
        the Swimming Pool and head directly to the changing rooms.
    </string>

    <string name="punctuality2">
        It is important that parents ensure their children are ready to start their class
        at the scheduled time with their required training equipment.
        \nWhen swimmers arrive late, it causes a disruption to the class
        and swimmers miss the warm up, which is a very important part of the training session.
    </string>

    <string name="training_equipment2">
        Swimsuit, Towel, Swimming Cap*, Goggles* are mandatory
        *will be available to buy directly at the pool
    </string>


    <string name="are_parents">
        Parents often ask if they need to stay at the pool during class time - this depends on your child’s age
    </string>

    <string name="are_parents2">
        •	A parent of swimmers aged less than 10 years are required to stay at the pool during their child is in a class.
        \n•	Parents of swimmers aged 10 years and over do not need to stay to watch their child’s class - this is optional.
        \n•	Parents of older swimmers (14 years+) are encouraged to occupy themselves during training rather than stay and watch their child train.
    </string>


    <string name="parent_etiquette">
        Parents who choose to watch their child’s class are asked to please
        sit in one of the areas where seating is provided. Please do not sit
        or stand on the pool deck as this should be kept clear for coaches and swimmers.
        \nParents should not attempt to communicate (verbally or non-verbally)
        with their child during a class - this causes distractions.
        \nParents should not talk or comment to the coach during class time.
        It is important that parents understand that coaches and students
        must not be interrupted whilst a class is being conducted.
    </string>

    <string name="communication_with_coaches2">
        Parents may, if necessary, briefly communicate with coaches after a class.
        \nNote: A reasonable amount of communication with your child\'s coach is approximately
        a few minutes each term
        \nIt is important that parents understand that coaches and students
        must not be interrupted whilst a class is being conducted.
        \nParents meetings will be organized in regular periods and any update will be
        announced and published.
        \nParents may request an additional meeting with the coach,
        please contact us if you wish to arrange this.
    </string>

    <string name="starting_the_class2">
        The responsible coach will welcome and collect the swimmers at the
        “kiss and drop” point in time to start the session.
        \nDuring the class your child is under full responsibility and supervision
        of the coach.
        \nWe request you support us doing our work at its best by let the coach teach
        and coach your child.
    </string>

    <string name="finishing_the_class2">
        After each session the coach will bring the group to the “kiss and drop”
        point and hand over responsibility and supervision to the parent.
    </string>

    <string name="locker_changing_rooms2">
        SH Aquatics does not provide supervision in the locker/changing rooms
        and we assume no liability for your belongings.
    </string>

    <string name="missed_class_policy_refund2">
        In general if a swimmer misses their regular class,
        no make-up classes will be provided.
        \nIf a swimmer will be unable to attend classes for a period of two or more weeks
        due to a significant injury or illness,
        an arrangement to switch the group will be provided.
        \n\nWe would appreciate your notification or announcement of any planned absence
        ahead. Attendance reports are made by the coaches directly.
        \n\nSH Aquatics do not offer refunds for Academy classes and swimming training services.
        In exceptional and medical circumstances, in which a valid doctor's certificate
        must be provided, partly refunds may be granted.
        \nAll refunds are awarded at the discretion of the managing director.
    </string>


    <string name="general_conduct2">
